This library wraps the tower-cli to isolate the {{.tower_cli.cfg}} between builds and users.

It takes 3 parameters:

host => The Tower host url
credentials => The credentials id stored in Jenkins for the Tower host
body = the block or closure of code to run with this configuration.

A temporary, random directory is created as the local working directory and a ./.tower_cli.cfg file is created based
input parameters. All commands are run within this isolated directory and the directory is deleted upon completion
of the block of steps.
