This library wraps the tower-cli to isolate the .tower_cli.cfg between builds and users.

It takes 3 parameters:

host => The Tower host url
credentials => The credentials id stored in Jenkins for the Tower host. Credentials can be global or folder level
body => the block of code to run with this configuration. This can contain shell steps to call the tower-cli.

E.g. 

withTower(host:"foo.com", credentials: "tower-cli"){
  sh 'tower-cli user list'
}

A ./.tower_cli.cfg file is created based input parameters. After all commands in body are executed the ./.tower_cli.cfg file is deleted. 

Because of the use of Jenkins Credentials the tower-cli config command will not reveal any username or password. These will be masked.
